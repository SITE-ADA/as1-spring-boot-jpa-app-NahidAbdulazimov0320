Instructions:
We have 2 entities: Student and Course.
To perform CRUD operations on them and some more, users should access localhost:8080/main.html page after executing the project through any of the java files.
Student and Course operations are separated. After entering chosen page, all CRUD operations will be obvious to unterstand because interface is userfriendly and self-explanatry. 
Additionally, there is a function not present in the webpage. Accessing a list of students through their name. User should change the url to localhost:8080/students/name/{name} and the list will be presented. 
To access the database, use localhost:8080/h2-database. Password:123
